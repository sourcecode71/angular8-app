## Quick Start
	Let the fun begin! The first thing we need to do is install Angular CLI globally, 
	so open the node.js command prompt and run this command:
	```
	npm install -g @angular/cli
	```

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/sourcecode71/angular8-app.git
 ```
 Then use the command cd angular8-app
 
 Run npm install for installing dependencies.
 
 Run npm start for a dev server, You will be automatically navigated to http://localhost:4201/.
 
 The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
